If you want to try out the examples here yourself, here are a couple of options:

## OpenShift Playground
You can use the OpenShift Playground to get access to a cluster for 60 minutes at a time. This option doesn't require you to install anything. This is the option we used for most of the examples on the site.

[OpenShift Playground](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45)

Click the red *START SCENARIO* button, and then you will have access to an OpenShift cluster via a web-based terminal window with `kubectl` available.

## Try OpenShift
Alternatively, you can head over to [openshift.com/try](https://openshift.com/try) for more ways to access or install an OpenShift cluster. For laptop installation see [CodeReadyContainers](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/).

## Other options
Another option is to install `minikube` or `kind`.  Minikube makes it easy to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine, while Kind uses containers to help you run "Kubernetes IN Docker".
